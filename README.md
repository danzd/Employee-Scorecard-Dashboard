# Employee-Scorecard-Dashboard
This is a complex project which aim was to create a dashboard in Power BI that will provide an overview on employee performance based on specific metrics. The dashboard is taking data from a SQL query, csv files and virtual tables created in Power Query and DAX. There are attached files with more information and explanation of the project, as well as a DEMO version of the dashboard (the sensitive data were modified or deleted to protect data privacy).
